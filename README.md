# Self-Balancing-Binary-Search-Trees
Self-Balancing Binary Search Trees (AVL, Splay), with examples

Regular, non-balancing, BSTs are also included.

Color flips are a way of representing arrays by using BSTs, for improved speed of operation.
By using AVL trees like here (self balancing trees in general), we keep the maximum height of a tree at O(log n), so all operations on the array take at most O(log n) time.
